 Tools Used & Our Experience
 Bootstrap
Using Bootstrap's grid system, we quickly created a responsive page layout and easily styled UI elements like navbars, alerts, and buttons without custom CSS. 
Our experience was positive, finding it straightforward to implement and appreciating the pre-built components that enabled a structured design

Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS was used to build a card-style layout using utility-first classes like `bg-white`, `rounded`, `shadow`, etc.  
We focused on creating a clean section with a headline, list, and call-to-action button.  
Experience: Tailwind gave us more flexibility but required more attention to layout and spacing. We enjoyed the precise control.

 React.js
We built an interactive React app using components and hooks. A `Team` component received a name via `props`, and a toggle button showed/hid team members using `useState()`.  
Experience: React made managing UI states easier. It was different from traditional HTML/JS but fun to use with JSX and components.
